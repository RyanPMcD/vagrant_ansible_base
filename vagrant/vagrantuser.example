# You should copy this file to .vagrantuser (either in ~ or the local directory)
# and fill it in. If you'd like to layer multiple .vagrantuser files, you should
# follow the directions in the 'nugrant' GitHub repo:
#
# https://github.com/maoueh/nugrant#quick-start
#
# HELPFUL NOTES:
# - If doing local development on Vagrant boxes, you'll want to use a local
#   path for dk.leaguehub.[web|redis].box_path. HOWEVER, Vagrant is not smart
#   enough to use this path preferentially; if you've already loaded a
#   Vagrant box, Vagrant will use the loaded one. You'll need to use
#   `vagrant box delete` before running `vagrant up`.
# - If you want to tell supervisord to take a powder and run the app manually
#   during development (helpful for getting error messages to stdout), set
#   dk.leaguehub.start_app_on_provision to false.
